In making any project, you should use the 3-tier architecture method to make it easy for you when creating a mobile version, a desktop app, or a web app all for the same project name.

# The 3 tiers are:

1. **Presentation Layer** (user interface of the application)
   - The only tier where we change its code whether for desktop, web, or mobile app.

2. **Business Layer** (for classes and calculations)

3. **Data Layer** (SQL server and stored procedures)
